*It's a Tool that make sure that you can Play Audio on Termux, there's an apk already at `libs` directory

## Version Update:

1.1 Brings fix to text interceptor, , now it wont broadcast errors

## What To do?

Execute this code here:
```
chmod +x run.sh && bash run.sh
```

It needs Root to start (If you're Not Using Bare Termux)
```
sudo bash main.sh
```

## Bugs

Spot them and Please Report, a diagnostic on your side may be important: `bash -v main.sh`

## Why did you made this?

I made this, because I've had enough, XSDL made by Pelya doesn't support RGB Encoding, so i took this onto my own hands. with the help of VNC viewer and some people in androidstack, its here!

To be honest Pelya should have made a separate app for Pulse server. this is painful but not anymooore!
